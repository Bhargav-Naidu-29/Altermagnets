# Growth Strategies for Altermagnet Mn₃Ga for Spintronic Applications

This repository contains the academic project **“Growth Strategies for Altermagnet Mn₃Ga for Spintronic Applications”**, which investigates the synthesis, phase evolution, and physical properties of Mn₃Ga as an altermagnetic material.  
All information documented here is **strictly derived from the project report and presentation included in this repository**, with no external assumptions or additions.

## Project Overview

Altermagnetism is a recently identified class of magnetic order characterized by **zero net magnetization combined with momentum-dependent spin splitting**, enabled by broken parity–time (PT) symmetry. Mn₃Ga, a binary Heusler alloy, exhibits multiple crystallographic phases with distinct magnetic behaviors, making it a suitable system for studying altermagnetic phenomena relevant to spintronic applications.

This project focuses on:
- Synthesizing Mn₃Ga using arc-melting techniques  
- Controlling phase formation via thermal annealing  
- Characterizing structural, magnetic, and transport properties  
- Classifying the altermagnetic nature of each phase

## Scientific Context

Conventional magnetic materials are classified as ferromagnets or antiferromagnets. Altermagnets occupy an intermediate category, combining advantages of both while avoiding stray magnetic fields. In Mn₃Ga, different crystal structures lead to collinear and non-collinear magnetic configurations, enabling the study of strong altermagnetism without relying on spin–orbit coupling.

## Material System Studied

- **Compound:** Mn₃Ga  
- **Composition:** 75 at.% Mn, 25 at.% Ga  
- **Crystallographic phases investigated:**
  - Cubic (disordered L1₂-type)
  - Tetragonal (D0₂₂)
  - Hexagonal (D0₁₉, β-phase)

Each phase exhibits distinct magnetic ordering, ranging from collinear antiferromagnetism to ferrimagnetism and non-collinear antiferromagnetism.

## Experimental Approach

### Synthesis Strategy

Mn₃Ga alloys were synthesized using **arc melting under an inert argon atmosphere**. High-purity elemental manganese and gallium were weighed according to the target stoichiometry. Multiple re-melting cycles were performed to ensure chemical homogeneity. A small excess of gallium was used to compensate for evaporation losses during melting.

An arc-melting furnace with a water-cooled copper hearth and tungsten electrode was employed under high-vacuum conditions.

### Thermal Processing and Phase Control

Phase evolution was achieved through controlled post-synthesis annealing:

- **As-cast condition:** Cubic phase  
- **350–450 °C annealing:** Tetragonal D0₂₂ phase  
- **600–800 °C annealing:** Hexagonal D0₁₉ β-phase  

The transformation to the hexagonal phase is reported as irreversible under the conditions studied.

## Characterization Techniques

Structural characterization was carried out using **X-ray diffraction (XRD)** with Cu Kα radiation, supported by Rietveld refinement for lattice parameter determination. Electron microscopy techniques, including STEM and SAED, were used for phase verification.

Magnetic properties were measured using **MPMS and VSM systems**, covering a temperature range from 2 K to 800 K and magnetic fields up to 70 kOe. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to identify phase transitions.

Transport measurements, including Hall resistivity and magnetoresistance, were conducted using a **Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS)**, particularly for the hexagonal phase.

### Magnetic Behavior

- **Cubic phase:** Collinear antiferromagnetic ordering with Néel temperature ≈ 420 K  
- **Tetragonal phase:** Ferrimagnetic ordering with high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and coercivity up to 21.4 kOe  
- **Hexagonal β-phase:** Non-collinear antiferromagnetic ordering with 120° in-plane spin structure and Néel temperature ≈ 490 K

### Transport and Altermagnetic Signatures

The hexagonal β-phase exhibits:
- Large anomalous Hall conductivity (~500 Ω⁻¹ cm⁻¹)
- Anomalous Nernst effect
- Topological Hall effect at low temperatures

Based on symmetry and magnetic analysis presented in the project:
- Cubic phase is classified as an **S-type altermagnet**
- Tetragonal and hexagonal β-phases are classified as **M-type altermagnets**
- All phases are identified as **strong altermagnets**
